# distlist

List of linux distros.

This Repository is a list Of linux Distros and thier .iso files. they are sorted into 3 catigories based on usage, like a just works distro or a minimalist distro. in those catigories are folders in which the distros are based on (for example an arch sub folder).

thanks, and suck my di- i mean, uh, goodbye for now.
